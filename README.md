# Open API Client Generator

## Overview

The primary goal of this thesis project is to develop a tool/generator capable of creating a frontend application client based on the Open API specification (in either JSON or YAML format). This tool ensures the efficiency and usability of the generated client by performing the following actions:

- **Trimming Unnecessary Functions**: Once the application/module is completed, it removes any superfluous functions from the generated classes.

- **Simplified Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface for each function. Users are spared from filling out numerous optional parameters, allowing them to input only those they deem necessary.

- **Documentation Generation**: The tool offers the added benefit of generating documentation for better usability and understanding.

## Open Source

This tool is proudly offered as an open-source project. The broader developer community can benefit from its functionalities, contribute to its growth, or simply make use of it in their projects.

## Distribution
